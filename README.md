<h2>Assignment and Communication</h2>

<p>New tickets are assigned to support agents either manually or through automated routing rules based on category or urgency. Agents communicate with the requester by adding responses or internal notes to clarify the issue or request additional information.</p>

<h2>Working the Issue</h2>

<p>Agents investigate and work on resolving the ticket. They update the ticket status as they progress, such as marking it “Open,” “Pending,” or “On Hold.” All actions and communications are logged to maintain a clear history.</p>

<h2>Resolution</h2>

<p>Once the agent has addressed the issue, the ticket is marked as “Resolved.” The requester receives notification to confirm the resolution. After confirmation, the ticket is closed and archived, completing the ticket lifecycle.</p>
